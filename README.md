<h3>Plugin Description:</h3>

Passky provides enhanced security measures to protect your server from username theft. By implementing Passky, unauthorized players are restricted from performing actions such as block placement, movement, command usage, and accessing the inventory. Additionally, it has the capability to automatically kick players with unusually long or short usernames, providing an extra layer of protection.

With Passky's Session Login feature, you no longer need to manually authenticate yourself every time you connect to the server. This feature streamlines the login process, making it more convenient and efficient for players.

Furthermore, Passky offers a comprehensive configuration file that allows you to fine-tune the settings according to your specific needs. Every command and feature can be easily enabled or disabled through the well-organized configuration file, giving you full control over the security measures implemented on your server.
